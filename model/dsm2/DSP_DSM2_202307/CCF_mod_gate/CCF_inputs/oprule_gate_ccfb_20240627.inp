## ==== Clifton Court Gate Operation ====
# The opening of the gate is contingent on the priority eligibility and if the water level outside the forebay is higher than inside.
# The gate will close early if the volume of water above the 2 ft contour is sufficient to cover the rest of the allocation for the day. This is to simulate the field operation where the operators try to 
# keep water elevation as close to 2 ft as possible. Without the closing early clause the water level in CC would tend to equilibrate to the outside WL which is around 5ft. 
# Similarly, we also have the oposite rule where the gate will remain open if the amount of water above the 2ft contour is not sufficient to cover the allocation. This is a safegard against the water level 
# inside the forebay to get too low. 

# The gate default height is 16 ft, however it will be set to a lower value to protect flow from exceeding 12,000 cfs. This reflects the real life operation. 
# The function to calculate the gate heights is derived from a simplification of the flow rating (ref. AR2015-6) so that it is only function of the head difference.
# The reason for the simplification is that the real equation was too long for the current oprule interface. It was found that the gate formula can be represented exactly in a simple exponential 12.054*head^-0.334. 
# where head is (wl_upstream - wl_reservoir). However it was found that in the field the gate is operated more concervatively and I found that an offset version of the equation give the best results. 
# The final formulate is the following Gate Height = 11*(wl_upstream - wl_reservoir)^-0.3 - 0.5. This gate formula is present in the gate_height but also in the calculation of the gate_coef

# In addition there is also a time serie of maximum gate height based on export level. This is to emulate the sipping condition during low export (i.e. < 4000cfs). 
# 6/28/2024 added a MAX2 statement in the gate height to avoid NaN when (chan_stage(channel=232,dist=0)-res_stage(res=clifton_court))<0
